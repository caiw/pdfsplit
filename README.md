# pdfsplit

Split pdfs on blank pages.

Install dependences like:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Use from Terminal command line like:

	python pdfsplit.py "/absolute/path/to/combined.pdf"
  
It'll make a set of pdfs in the same directory (`/absolute/path/to/`), splitting the original on its blank pages.

A blank page is one with no text.
